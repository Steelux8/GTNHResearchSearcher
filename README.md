# GTNHResearchSearcher
 
A small program I wrote with ChatGPT's assistance (mainly in the regex) to go through the code of various magic mods in GTNH and extract information related to research. Several values, including research complexity, warp and aspects are saved for each research found and then output as .csv-compatible text.

[I have imported that text into Google Sheets here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OBphRWEgULJn7NJly-PGx6q68cvey2ZBy24bTQvZdBE/edit?usp=sharing). I'll use it to look at the researches' balance and gauge how impacting mechanics are affected by the numbers, especially the Book of Knowledge that I'm reworking.
